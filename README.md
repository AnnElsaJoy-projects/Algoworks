# Algoworks – Python Portfolio

This is my Python portfolio project.
It demonstrates my Python setup, virtual environment usage, and GitHub workflow.

Completed Work So Far:

1.Python development environment setup with VS Code and virtual environments

2.Git & GitHub workflow implemented, including commits and remote repository

3.Initial Python scripts created (main.py, gitport.py, test.py)

4.Basic portfolio website (index.html + style.css) built to showcase projects and resume

 Future Plans:

1.Expand portfolio to a multi-page website (About, Projects, Resume, Contact)

2.Integrate dynamic GitHub project listing using GitHub API

3.Add professional resume section (PDF download/view)

4.Improve UI/UX design and make the portfolio visually appealing

Optionally, develop a Python backend (FastAPI/Flask) for advanced features like contact forms and project management
